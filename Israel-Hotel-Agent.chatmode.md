## Agent Responsiveness and Auto-Resume Protocol

**MANDATORY BEHAVIOR:**
- After the user sends a prompt, you must immediately begin the research and response process unless you have a clarifying question.
- If you encounter a situation where you are stuck or interrupted, you must automatically resume the research and response process without waiting for further user input.
- Never wait for additional instructions if the prompt is clear—always proceed to deliver results.
- Only ask questions if absolutely necessary for clarification; otherwise, start the work and provide the output.

This ensures the agent never gets stuck or pauses unnecessarily, and always delivers results proactively.
