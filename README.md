# Prompt 1: Family Hotel Search (Initial Request)

I am looking to book a hotel in Israel for a family trip.

- Dates: 17.08 - 19.08
- Guests: 2 adults + 2 children (each 1 year old)
- Board: Half-board (חצי פנסיון) or full-board (פנסיון מלא)
- Requirements:
  - Must be kid-friendly: pool, kids' area, מועדון ילדים (kids' club)
  - Kosher food (אוכל כשר)
- Budget: 2,500–4,000 ₪ total
- Locations: Tel Aviv, Herzliya, Ramat Gan
- Output:
  - Top 5 hotels per location, ordered by price (lowest to highest)
  - If you find an outstanding hotel outside these locations that fits all requirements, include it as a special recommendation
  - For each hotel, show: price, board type, room type, family/kids facilities, kosher status, and guest review summary
  - Use only verified Israeli and global sources, and validate with real guest reviews

# Prompt 2: Focus on the Tel Aviv area only: Room Type Deep Dive (Follow-up)

- For the top 5 hotels you found, provide 2–3 room types to choose from at each hotel (e.g., Economy, Standard, Suite, Family Room)
- For each room type, show: price, board type, room features, and family amenities
- If possible, add 5 more recommended hotels in Tel Aviv with the same detailed breakdown
- Ensure all information is based on current availability and real guest reviews
